description: 'API reference for UI8Kit Core primitive components - Block, Box, Grid, Flex, and Stack with variant system documentation'
---

This page provides complete API reference documentation for the five fundamental primitive components in `src/core/ui/`. These are Layer 1 components (atoms) that serve as the foundational building blocks for all higher-level components in the library.

**Scope**: This page covers only the core primitives: `Block`, `Box`, `Grid`, `Flex`, and `Stack`. For extended UI components (Button, Card, Badge, etc.), see [**UI Components**](https://app.devin.ai/wiki/ui8kit/core#4.2). For architectural explanations and composition patterns, see [**Core Components**](https://app.devin.ai/wiki/ui8kit/core#3.1).

## **Component Overview**

The core primitives provide low-level rendering capabilities with direct access to the CVA variant system. They render semantic HTML5 elements while accepting variant props for styling.
